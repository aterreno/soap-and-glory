- try swagger-express https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node-express or https://github.com/worldline/swagger-jack

https://gist.github.com/antoinegomez/5468436 < cool? nope it's a generator

- or apigee-127 , not sure why this got killed, if they want to use swagger - probaby they just don't know

- how do you design a rest endpoint which is clean json and then have the xml endpoint and they both talk to soap?

- need opera connectivity

- node-soap vs templating 

- 'layered architecture' - how to - node modules ? 

- I suppose I can do an end2end, get a request as it is on jasmine, make a rest one myself and produce something that is the same as what soapUI suggests

- prep for friday
